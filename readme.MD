# Studienarbeit Repository

Inside this repository, you can read the code that I created for my thesis regarding "Website-Pentests" <br>
It will be used to track my progress as well as to have guidance for usage.

## TODO

Pentest-Tool implementieren <br>
Dokumentieren<br>
Funktionen dokumentieren

### How to use

You can run the program by using the command below. You have to switch inside the cmd directory:

```bash
python main.py --target=<IP-Address>
```

## Help

If there are any insecurities, you can use the following command to see what flags you can set.

```bash
python main.py --help
```

## Logging
The program automatically logs its progress. It will log it inside the cli and also into the 
result.log inside the documentation directory.

That way it is easier to keep track of all the processes together with documenting how vulnerable
the website is. It will collect data for the following types:

- Information: General Information that could be useful to know
- Warnings: Something that happened to the program
- Vulnerabilities with several levels as well as the step when they occurred
