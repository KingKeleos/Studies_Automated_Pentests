# Studienarbeit Repository

Inside this repository, you can read the code that I created for my thesis regarding "Website-Pentests" <br>
It will be used to track my progress as well as to have guidance for usage.

## How to use

To start the guided tests, you need to run the following command.

```bash
python main.py
```

The guide does not know what website you use it on. it is not automated, it is just documenting everything and helping you not forget tests.

It will currently check for the following vulnerabilites:
- Cross Site Scripting
- SQL Injection
- File Upload
- Session Hijacking

Other Vulnerabilites can be caught by the pentester themselves but also have to be documented by hand, as the software cannot do that yet.

## Pentesting Phases:
This Pentest Guide will be working in 6 phases, helping the pentester work through the entire pentest of the website

1. Phase Pre-Engagement:
    This phase will be executed by hand by the pentester, as the guide cannot take care of this phase.
2. Reconnaissance:
    The Guide will ask the pentester, to look for certain attributes of the website.
3. Thread Modelling:
    With the information from the second step, the guide will create the threats, that could come from those attributes.
4. Exploitation:
    The Exploitation will be done by hand, but the guide will use pre made scripts and commands, to help the pentester test the exlpoits.
5. Reporting:
    This phase will be done by the guide AND the pentester. The guide will create a markdown with all the information gathered througout the execution. And the pentester reads through the file and can edit it, as well as add some extra tests.
6. Retesting:
    Will be done by hand as well so far. The Report and Log will help the pentester do the same execution as last time.

## Logging

The software logs everything that is happening. Every input from the pentester, as well as the evaluation of the inputs. Those will be stored in the *results.log* in the *result* directory.

In it, you are able to see what type of event occured and during which step. This way the pentester can redo all the steps, that he took.

This log will then be used to create a *report.md* inside the *report* directory. This report hase to be edited by hand, if the pentester did some extra stuff next to the guide.

## Reporting

What the pentester has to do in the report, is written in the **TODO**-Section of the file.

After executing the guide, you will find a *reporting.md* inside the *reporting* directory. This can be used to
1. Give a report to the customer
2. Redo the tests, that have been done

The report will also have the name of the pentester, as well as the tested website.
